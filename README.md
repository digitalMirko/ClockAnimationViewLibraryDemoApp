Android ClockAnimation View Library Demo App

App created in Android Studio 3.0.1 and tested on a Genymotion Google Nexus 5X Android Emulator then on a Motorola Moto X Developer 
Edition Android phone.

To use this app the user just clicks the 'ClockAnimationView Library Demo App' icon and they are taken right into the app. 
They are greeted with a large clock face in the middle set to 12:00, followed by a labeled button on the bottom. As the user 
clicks the button it changes to the labeled position that is designated on the button. The defauly position is labeled 'Set to 2:30'. 
So when the user clicks it the clock moves the dials around in a counter clockwise position to give a graphic representation of that 
time. In this demo the following times are available when clicked (in seqencial order): 2:30, 4:45, 7:15, 9:50, 11:30 and finally 12:00.
